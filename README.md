Introduction to R
================

## What is R? What is RStudio?

The term “R” is used to refer to both the programming language and the
software that interprets the scripts written using it.

[RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) is currently a very popular way to not
only write your R scripts but also to interact with the R software. To
function correctly, RStudio needs R and therefore both need to be
installed on your computer.

## Why R?

### R does not involve lots of pointing and clicking, and that’s a good thing

The learning curve might be steeper than with other software, but with
R, the results of your analysis do not rely on remembering a succession
of pointing and clicking, but instead on a series of written commands,
and that’s a good thing\! So, if you want to redo your analysis because
you collected more data, you don’t have to remember which button you
clicked in which order to obtain your results; you just have to run your
script again.

Working with scripts makes the steps you used in your analysis clear,
and the code you write can be inspected by someone else who can give you
feedback and spot mistakes.

Working with scripts forces you to have a deeper understanding of what
you are doing, and facilitates your learning and comprehension of the
methods you use.

### R code is great for reproducibility

Reproducibility is when someone else (including your future self) can
obtain the same results from the same dataset when using the same
analysis.

R integrates with other tools to generate manuscripts from your code. If
you collect more data, or fix a mistake in your dataset, the figures and
the statistical tests in your manuscript are updated automatically.

An increasing number of journals and funding agencies expect analyses to
be reproducible, so knowing R will give you an edge with these
requirements.

### R is interdisciplinary and extensible

With 10,000+ packages that can be installed to extend its capabilities,
R provides a framework that allows you to combine statistical approaches
from many scientific disciplines to best suit the analytical framework
you need to analyze your data. For instance, R has packages for image
analysis, GIS, time series, population genetics, and a lot more.

### R works on data of all shapes and sizes

The skills you learn with R scale easily with the size of your dataset.
Whether your dataset has hundreds or millions of lines, it won’t make
much difference to you.

R is designed for data analysis. It comes with special data structures
and data types that make handling of missing data and statistical
factors convenient.

R can connect to spreadsheets, databases, and many other data formats,
on your computer or on the web.

### R produces high-quality graphics

The plotting functionalities in R are endless, and allow you to adjust
any aspect of your graph to convey most effectively the message from
your data.

### R has a large and welcoming community

Thousands of people use R daily. Many of them are willing to help you
through mailing lists and websites such as Stack Overflow, or on the
RStudio community.

### Not only is R free, but it is also open-source and cross-platform

Anyone can inspect the source code to see how R works. Because of this
transparency, there is less chance for mistakes, and if you (or someone
else) find some, you can report and fix bugs.

## Workshop objectives

We assume no previous knowledge of R or any other programming language
with this workshop. We’re starting from the beginning\! The major
objectives of this workshop are to

  - Familiarize you with R and RStudio functionality,

  - Help you understand the basics of R programming,

  - Give you the tools to work with your own data, and

  - Help you get help
