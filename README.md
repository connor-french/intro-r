Presentation of RStudio Start RStudio – Let’s start by learning about
our tool.

Console, Scripts, Environments, Plots Code and workflow are more
reproducible if we can document everything that we do. Our end goal is
not just to “do stuff” but to do it in a way that anyone can easily and
exactly replicate our workflow and results. Before we get started Under
the File menu, click on New project, choose New directory, then Empty
project Enter a name for this new folder, and choose a convenient
location for it. This will be your working directory for the rest of the
day (e.g., \~/data-carpentry) Confirm that the folder named in the
Create project as a sub-directory of box is where you want the working
directory created. Use the Browse button to navigate folders if changes
are needed. Click on “Create project” Under the Files tab on the right
of the screen, click on New Folder and create a folder named data within
your newly created working directory. (e.g., \~/data-carpentry/data)
Create a new R script (File \> New File \> R script) and save it in your
working directory (e.g. data-carpentry-script.R)
